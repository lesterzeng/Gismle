## General Approach

We took the vertical approach, where 1 person focus on the backend and 2 people focus on the frontend but we help each other if there were any difficulty in the backend or frontend.
After creating the required pages and components for the frontend and creating the required endpoints for the backend, we tried to connect the frontend and backend together via fetching. 

we tried mapping the list of boards after fetching the data from the backend and also attaching a delete button for each board to return the boardId so the endpoint knows what board to delete. we do similar fetching technique for the cards and comments.
